## Thing \#2: CSS + JS Clock

*A real-time analog clock (well, it looks analog) that displays the current time!*

Another fun build!

Ok, the 7 takeaways.

1. Explore, play, and experiment with your preferred Dev Tools. It's a great way to immediately see the effects of CSS properties. For example, we experimented with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function" target="_blank">`transition-timing-function`</a> property. We created a realistic ticking second hand using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/single-transition-timing-function#The_cubic-bezier()_class_of_timing-functions">`cubic-bezier`</a> function value. "Cubi-wha?!".
